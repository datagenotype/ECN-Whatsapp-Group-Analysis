# ECN-Whatsapp-Group-Analysis
### Introduction

Ecn 19 means economics students that graduated in the year 2019 from the economics department. The group consists of students and information is passed across the group. The dataset was exported from whatsapp as flat text file which consists of 1169 observations and four columns.

The followings are the libraries used in the analysis:
* Pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* datetime

After I imported the libraries needed, I went ahead to import the file which is in a flat text file format. While I was exploring the data, the data wasn't in form of rows and columns. So, i had to clean it up and make the data look tidy. After the data cleaning, I wss able to come up with the following columns or variables:
* data
* time
* phone number
* messages
