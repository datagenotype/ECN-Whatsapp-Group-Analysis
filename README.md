The dataset was exported from whatsapp as flat text file which consists of 1169 observations and four columns.The purpose of this analysis to check the total number of messages, the date that has the highest chat and the phone number that has the highest chat. 

The followings are the libraries used in the analysis:

After I imported the libraries needed, I went ahead to import the file which is in a flat text file format. While I was exploring the data, the data wasn't in form of rows and columns. So, i had to clean it up and make the data look tidy. After the data cleaning, I wss able to come up with the following columns or variables:
